# OpenCV_Exer

Exercise 1:

A program reads the cvMat object with the inputs of rows, columns, and type, which creates a new two-dimensional matrix. It also consists a pointer to the Matrix containing the pixel values, which is being represented by multiple color channels. In order to get the pixel intensity value, you have to know the type of an image and the number of channels.
